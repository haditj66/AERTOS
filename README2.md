## Overview

 AERTOS came about as a need to rapidly prototype embedded applications without having to worry about the details of RTOS mechanisms such as semaphores and tasks. Instead this is abstracted with concepts of a event-driven architecture. Finite state machines, Service calls, signal processing blocks are a few examples of the concepts used in AERTOS. Below is an example of what can be possible with AERTOS. This is a basic on-off control system for maintaining the desired acceleration of whatever you can imagine.
